# Demo-Page

A mock page for an app made in React Native. 

To run this project, simply ensure NPM/Yarn is installed (preferably NPM, you can head over to www.nodejs.org/downloads to download and install that).

1) Run 'git clone https://github.com/ARKEOLOGIST/Demo-Page.git'. It creates a folder in your main directory. 
2) Run 'npm install -g expo-cli'. 
3) Navigate to the cloned folder in the main directory using the 'cd' command.
4) Run 'npm start'.

That's it for the server. For running it on mobile :-
1) Install Expo from the Play Store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent) or Expo Client from the App Store (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779)
2) Navigate to Projects (bottom-left corner of the screen, leftmost tab).
3) Scan the QR code given in the CLI running the server (that popped up when you ran 'npm start'). 
4) Wait a few seconds for the app to build.
5) Enjoy!
